= AKS Node and Control-Plane Maintenance

AKS allows you to upgrade your Kubernetes control-plane and nodes.
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster[Upgrade an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster].

Node images can also be upgraded.
AKS provides one new image per week with the latest updates,
see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/node-image-upgrade[Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node image upgrade].

Also check https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases[AKS Release Notes] for details on a release.

== Kubernetes Control Plane upgrade

Change the parameter `cluster_version` in your `aks-terraform` repository to change the Kubernetes version.
When applied, AKS starts with the upgrade process as described https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster#upgrade-an-aks-cluster[here]

If the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster#set-auto-upgrade-channel[upgrade channel] for the Kubernetes Cluster is set to `patch`, (in terraform using the `automatic_channel_upgrade` variable), the cluster will update automatically to the latest patch level kubernetes version.
Therefore the variable `cluster_version` might not match the current state of your cluster.
Verify the cluster version and upgrade `cluster_version` before applying.

== Node Image Upgrade

Login via the azure cli to the correct tenant first:

[source,shell]
----
az login [--tenant XXXX]
----

Check latest node image version available for your node pool with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
az aks nodepool get-upgrades \
    --nodepool-name mynodepool \
    --cluster-name myAKSCluster \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup
----

Then compare this with your current node image version by running:

[source,shell]
----
az aks nodepool show \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --cluster-name myAKSCluster \
    --name mynodepool \
    --query nodeImageVersion
----

To upgrade the node image, use the following command:

[source,shell]
----
az aks nodepool upgrade \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --cluster-name myAKSCluster \
    --name mynodepool \
    --node-image-only
----

During the upgrade, check the status of the node images with the following `kubectl` command to get the labels and filter out the current node image information:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubernetes\.azure\.com\/node-image-version}{"\n"}{end}'
----

== AKS Maintenance Image

The procedure described aboved was put into a script that is included in the following container image: https://github.com/appuio/container-aks-maintenance
